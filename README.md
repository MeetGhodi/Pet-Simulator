Users have the option to name and select a pet species (dog, cat, or rabbit). The application lets users give their pet food, play with it, and give it some downtime; each activity has an impact on the pet's hunger, contentment, and well-being. It features time-lapse simulation, crucial stat warnings, and status monitoring. It also incorporates repercussions for neglect, like the pet's health declining if it is overfed or unhappy. Instructions for interacting are provided by the user-friendly and transparent interface.
